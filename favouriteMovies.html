<p>Absolute favorite movie ever, in my opinion, the best apperarences of<br/> 
   John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Wing Rhymes and Uma Thurman ever!!!
</p>
<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy 1</h3>

<p>I repeatedly watched this daily for a long while. When you don't get tired of the<br/> 
    same movie everyday it means it's that good.
</p>
<h3>The Lord of The Rings(Trilogy) </h3>

<p>
    It has to be the trilogy, because one movie makes such a good connection to the<br/> 
    next one that it feels something is missing if you don't watch the whole trilogy.
