<h1>The Best Movies According to Gustavo</h1>
<h2>This a very simple, first steps project where I listed my 3 favourite movies</br
    >(actually 5, if you count the LOTR trilogy separately). Hope you like it! </h2>

<h3 >Pulp Fiction</h3>
<img  src="https://http2.mlstatic.com/D_NQ_NP_615735-MLA74272985428_022024-B.webp" width="100" alt="Cover picture of the movie Pulp Fiction"/>
<div>
<p>More than just a film, Pulp Fiction feels like a secret club you’re lucky enough to be in. It’s that album you know by
heart, where every line, every song, and every scene shift feels like a personal touchstone. This isn't just a movie I
watch; it's one I visit.
<p>
Quentin Tarantino’s 1994 landmark work reassembled the DNA of cinema with a reckless, brilliant confidence. By chopping
up three crime stories and stitching them back together out of order, he did something magical: he made us focus not on
what happens, but on how it happens. We already know Butch (Bruce Willis) survives his ordeal, so the tension in the
pawn shop basement becomes not about survival, but about the sheer, horrific experience. It’s a film that trusts its
audience completely.</p>
<p>
What I adore, and what makes it feel so intimate upon every rewatch, is the glorious contradiction at its heart. These
are hitmen discussing the ethics of a foot massage and the virtues of a "Royale with Cheese" moments before a brutal
execution. It’s a boxer listening to "Misirlou" before betraying a crime lord, clinging to his father’s watch. It’s the
terrifying, almost slapstick horror of an adrenaline needle to the heart. The dialogue isn't just cool; it’s the soul of
the film, revealing the humanity (or lack thereof) in these characters.</p>
<p>
The performances are etched into cinematic history. John Travolta’s charming, weary Vincent Vega, Samuel L. Jackson’s
biblical and terrifying Jules, and Uma Thurman’s radiant, dangerously playful Mia—they don’t feel like characters, they
feel like people.</p>
<p>
For me, Pulp Fiction is the definition of timeless. Its razor-sharp writing, iconic soundtrack, and breathtaking style
never get old. It’s a film that made me fall in love with the art of storytelling, and it remains, without a doubt, one
of my all-time favourites.

<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy vol.1</h3>
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQbZO-cKNSAhMID1QNVJatj_38X5vg3w5FsYg&s" width="100" alt="Cover picture of the movie Guardians of the Galaxy"/>
<p>Before 2014, the idea of a talking raccoon and a sentient tree becoming one of the most emotionally resonant duos in
cinema seemed absurd. But that’s the magic of Guardians of the Galaxy. James Gunn didn’t just make a superhero movie; he
crafted a spectacularly weird, heartfelt letter to the loners, the losers, and anyone who has ever found their family in
the most unexpected place.</p>
<p>
On the surface, it’s a cosmic romp—a rollicking adventure with spaceship chases and a quest for a powerful orb. But at
its core, this is a story about a boy who ran away abducted by aliens, still grieving for his mother, and the fellow
misfits he collects along the way. They are a thief, an assassin, a rage-fueled brute, a genetically engineered raccoon,
and a tree that only speaks three words. They shouldn’t work, but they do, spectacularly.</p>
<p>
What makes this film so deeply personal to me is its perfect balance of humor and heart. The comedy is sharp and
character-driven, from Rocket’s endless scheming to Drax’s literal-minded brilliance. Yet, the film never shies away
from its emotional weight. Peter Quill listening to his "Awesome Mix" tape to feel connected to a home he lost, Gamora’s
yearning for redemption, and the simple, profound loyalty of Groot—these moments land with genuine force.</p>
<p>
And oh, that soundtrack. The "Awesome Mix Vol. 1" isn't just background music; it's the film's soul. It’s the thread
that connects a scruffy space captain to a small boy on Earth, turning "Hooked on a Feeling" and "Come and Get Your
Love" into anthems of found family.</p>
<p>
Guardians of the Galaxy is a vibrant, hilarious, and surprisingly tender reminder that we are all a little broken, but
we don't have to be alone. It’s a big-budget spectacle that feels like a warm, cosmic hug, and that’s why it has a
permanent spot in my heart.</p>

</p>
<h3>The Lord of The Rings(Trilogy) </h3>
<img  src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR3mQdQk9JsOFbjePQh3FavG5GqDGdDMOm-5g&s" width="100" alt="Picture of the cover of the Trilogy Lord of the Rings"/> <br/>
<p>
    For me, The Lord of the Rings is more than a trilogy of films; it is a journey I return to, a world I inhabit. It’s the
    cinematic equivalent of a well-worn, beloved book—its edges frayed from countless visits, its landscapes feeling as
    familiar as home. Peter Jackson’s monumental achievement isn’t just in the epic scale, but in the profound intimacy he
    finds within it.</p>
    
    <p>
    This isn't merely a story about hobbits, wizards, and elves. At its heart, it’s a story about the quiet, stubborn
    courage of ordinary people. It’s about the weight of a simple gold ring and the immense burden of hope. We don't follow
    untouchable superheroes; we follow a frightened hobbit from the Shire who wishes none of this had happened, a warrior
    king grappling with his lineage, and an elf and dwarf who discover friendship is stronger than ancient prejudice.</p>
    <p>
    The trilogy’s true power lies in its moments of quiet humanity amidst the soaring battles. It's the heartbreaking grace
    of Sam carrying Frodo up the slopes of Mount Doom, whispering, "I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you." It's the
    warmth of Aragorn gently telling the hobbits, "You bow to no one." It's the sorrow in Arwen's choice and the loyalty of
    Samwise Gamgee, the true hero of the story. These are the moments that bring tears to my eyes every single time, because
    they speak to the best parts of us: loyalty, friendship, and the resilience of the human (and hobbit) spirit.</p>
    <p>
    The painstaking craftsmanship—from the practical sets of Hobbiton to Howard Shore’s majestic, soul-stirring
    score—creates a world that feels utterly tangible and alive. It’s a place you believe in completely.</p>
    <p>
    The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a timeless epic about finding the strength to face the darkness, both in the world and
    within ourselves, and it reminds us that even the smallest person can change the course of the future. It is, and will
    always be, my ultimate escape and my greatest comfort.</p>
